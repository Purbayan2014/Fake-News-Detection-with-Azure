# About

Opinions such as online reviews are the main source of information for e-commerce customers to help with gaining insight into the products they are planning to buy. Fake news and misleading articles is another form of opinion spam, which has gained traction. Some of the biggest sources of spreading fake news or rumors are social media websites such as Google Plus, Facebook, Twitters, and other social media outlet For this project, I've tried creating a Fake News Detector . For this project I have used the data set to train and test the model and then finally deploy it on the web using azure web services.


# Problem regarding Fake News

In the modern democratic society the proliferation of the fake news is a huge problem amid the people of the society.It also affects the well being of the people especially during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic.On the social media fake news spread way more faster than the facts .So I have developed this web app to minimize the chance of spreading the fake news and facts.


# Usage

# Sample Cases from the dataset

`Clinton invited her audience to read Trump’s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, “Donald Trump and the Iraq War.”` (FAKE)

`"Trump takes on Cruz, but lightly","Killing Obama administration rules, dismantling Obamacare and pushing through tax reform are on the early to-do list."` (REAL)

`Trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name, but he’s far from assured of the majority of delegates he’d need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality, the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts don't start paying dividends soon, though, Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegates—and leave without the nomination."` (REAL)

`For now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in."` (REAL)

`Nate Terani is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in military intelligence with the Defense Intelligence Agency. He is currently a member of the leadership team at Common Defense PAC and regional campaign organizer with Veterans Challenge Islamophobia . He is a featured columnist with the Arizona Muslim Voice newspaper. (Reprinted from TomDispatch by permission of author or representative)"`  (FAKE)
